# PreFRBLE

PreFRBLE is a python package build to compare observations of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to theoretical predictions. To this end, it predicts the contribution to FRB observables from the different regions along the line of sight. The results for different contributors are combined to predict the full measurement, considering several possible scenarios. Finally, observations are weighed against the probability of the full measurement to obtain the model likelihood.


Package is currentky under construction, await amazing results soon!!!
