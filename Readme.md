# PreFRBLE

PreFRBLE is a python package to predict, in terms of probability functions, the outcome of different models of contributors to FRB observables. The results for different contributors are combined to the full measurement. Finally, observations are weighed against the probability of the full measurement to obtain the likelihood.


Package is currentky under construction, await amazing results soon!!!
