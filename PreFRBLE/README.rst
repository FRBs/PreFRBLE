TuPy: A tutorial on how to build a Python package
=================================================
*PreFRBLE* is a Python package used to combine observations of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to theoretical predictions, made by @shackste. It provides a number of methods to derive likelihood functions for the contribution from models of different regions along the line of sight of FRBs. These are combined to realistic scenarios and compared to observational data in order to quantify the likelihood of different models to reproduce observations of FRBs.


Installation
------------
*PreFRBLE* can be easily installed by cloning the entire `repository`_ and installing it manually::

    $ git clone https://github.com/shackste/PreFRBLE
    $ cd PreFRBLE
    $ pip install .

*PreFRBLE* can now be imported with ``import PreFRBLE``.
