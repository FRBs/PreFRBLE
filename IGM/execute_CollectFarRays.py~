'''
Produce Probability functions of LoS observables for sources in the distant universe, outside the constrained volume
several snapshots of the simulation are combined using cosmological data stacking (e.g., da Silva et al. 2000)
Note that the light-travel distance between snapshots exceeds the simulation volume (Vazza-Hackstein models), hence LoS to high redshift are obtained by stacking segments, distributed randomly troughout the volume
