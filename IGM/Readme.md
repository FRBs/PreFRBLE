This folder contains procedures used to investiage a cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation of the intergalactic medium, produced with the ENZO code (enzo-project.org).
Many parameters of the simulation presented in Hackstein et al. 2018, 2019 & 2020a,b are hardcoded. use with caution. 


This part requires a lot of additional python packages, e. g. yt and trident, as well as intensive code modifications in order to be used for other models and simulation software.
Hence, this is not included in the standard PrEFRBLE package
